Minimum vertex cover on bipartite graph =
Maximum matching on bipartite graph =
Max flow with source to one side, other side to sink

To reconstruct the minimum vertex cover, dfs from each
unmatched vertex on the left side and with unused edges
only. Equivalently, dfs from source with unused edges
only and without visiting sink. Then, a vertex is chosen
iff. it is on the left side and without visited or on
the right side and visited through dfs.


Maximum density subgraph ( \sum W_e + \sum W_v ) / |V|

Binary search on answer:
For a fixed D, construct a Max flow model as follow:
Let S be Sum of all weight( or inf)
1. from source to each node with cap = S
2. For each (u,v,w) in E, (u->v,cap=w), (v->u,cap=w)
3. For each node v, from v to sink with cap = S + 2 * D - deg[v] - 2 * (W of v)
where deg[v] = \sum weight of edge associated with v
If maxflow < S * |V|, D is an answer.

Requiring subgraph: all vertex can be reached from source with
edge whose cap > 0.
